          <h2 id="home">Front End Technologies</h2>
          <p>Front-end technologies are an essential part of any business that strives to enhance user interaction, 
            efficiency, and the look and feel of their website or application. Development teams use front-end 
            technologies to create a website’s design, structure, animation, and everything you see on the screen 
            when you open it.</p>
         
          <h3 id="react">React.js</h3>
          <p>
            ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source JavaScript front-end library for creating 
            dynamic and interactive applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically, it’s responsible only for 
            the view layer. Facebook initially developed and maintained the technology, which was then used in some 
            of its products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as Next.js, React can be utilized 
            for developing single-page, mobile, or server-side applications. It allows code to be debugged more 
            efficiently by separating it into components.<br>
            More than 220,000 websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use this platform for 
            their applications/websites include Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.
          </p>
          <p>Key Features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The application built with ReactJS has a component-based architecture, meaning that it consists of several components, each with its own logic written in JS. The reusable nature of these components allows you to maintain the code when working on larger-scale projects.</li>
           <br> <li>ReactJS is designed to support unidirectional data flow and one-way data binding. One-way data-binding gives you more control across your application.</li>
           <br> <li>The Virtual DOM of React offers flexibility and speeds up app development. Document object models (DOMs) are APIs (Application programming interfaces) that manage how documents can be accessed and manipulated.</li>
          <br>  <li>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a markup syntax for describing the interface of an application.  With JSX, you can write and add HTML structures easily in React.</li>
          <br>  <li>With declarative UI, React code can be more easily read and fixed. In terms of developing UIs that are exciting and engaging, React JS is the best choice not just for web applications but also for mobile applications.</li>
          </ul>

            AngularJS is an open-source Javascript front-end framework and is an integral part of the MEAN stack
            (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, And Node.js). It is mostly used for developing single-page web 
            applications (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework, developers can create progressive web apps or 
            integrate the framework with technologies such as Ionic, Cordova, or NativeScripy to design near-native 
            mobile applications.<br>
            The tool has inbuilt templates that make it easy for developers to build UI views quickly. AngularJS 
            provides simple, fast data binding without developer intervention. By supporting caching, it reduces 
            the CPU’s workload. It provides fast loading and less navigation, ensuring an effective user experience. 
            Gmail, Forbes, Upwork,  Deutsche Bank, etc., are some of the popular websites and applications built using 
            Angular.js.

            frameworks for creating a lightweight and adaptable interactive UI elements. The MVVM model 
            (Model View-View Model) architecture pattern and its lightweight nature make Vue.js extremely easy 
            to implement.<br>
            HTML and CSS knowledge is required to use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the view 
            layer. Frameworks like this can be seamlessly integrated into big projects for front-end development without 
            causing any problems or issues. 9GAG, GitLab, Nintendo, Behance, and Laravel are some of the popular websites 
            and applications built using Vue.js.
